## Serenede.js is a light and compact client-side framework for building living, breathing web pages

Serenade.js is a client side framework built on the MVC pattern. It makes it
simple to create rich client side applications by freeing you from having to
keep the DOM up to date with your data through powerful data bindings.

Serenade.js is simple enough to get you started quickly, yet powerful enough to
create rich and complex applications.

<ol class="usps">
  <li>
    <h3>Simple</h3>
    <p>
      Get started in a single line of code. No need to create complicated graphs of
      objects, just start working.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Plays nice</h3>
    <p>
      Serenade gets out of your way. You can integrate it into your existing
      applications today, because it plays well with all existing JavaScript code.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Data bindings</h3>
    <p>
      Serenade's templates automatically update when your data changes. No need for
      any special wiring, everything is kept current all the time.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Small</h3>
    <p>
      Serenade is just 11k gzipped and has absolutely zero dependencies. No
      jQuery, no special adapters, no nothing. Just drop a single JS file into
      your app and start working.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
