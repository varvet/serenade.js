<ol class="usps">
  <li>
    <h3>Simple</h3>
    <p>
      Get started in a single line of code. No need to create complicated graphs of
      objects, just start working.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Plays nice</h3>
    <p>
      Serenade gets out of your way. You can integrate it into your existing
      applications today, because it plays well with all existing JavaScript code.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Data bindings</h3>
    <p>
      Serenade's templates automatically update when your data changes. No need for
      any special wiring, everything is kept current all the time.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Small</h3>
    <p>
      Serenade is just 11k gzipped and has absolutely zero dependencies. No
      jQuery, no special adapters, no nothing. Just drop a single JS file into
      your app and start working.
    </p>
